🤖 Artificial Intelligence Lab: Student Performance Evaluation 🎓
Welcome to the Student Performance Evaluation project — a Prolog-based knowledgebase designed to analyze and assess student academic records efficiently! This system models marks, attendance, assignments, family ties, and subject prerequisites to generate insightful academic evaluations.

✨ Features
👩‍🎓 Represent students, subjects, and marks using Prolog facts

🅰️ Automatic grade calculation (A, B, C, D, F)

✅ Pass/fail status determination per subject

➕ Compute total and average marks

🏆 Identify toppers and weak students

🎓 Scholarship eligibility check based on performance and attendance

🔗 Enforce subject prerequisites (e.g., pass math before physics)

👪 Compare performance within family relationships

🛠️ Tools & Languages Used
💻 Programming Language: Prolog (Logic Programming) — Perfect for knowledge representation & logical reasoning

⚙️ Interpreter: SWI-Prolog — Open-source, powerful, and widely used for Prolog projects

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Al-Mamuun/Artificial-Intelligence-Lab-.git

Load the Prolog source file in SWI-Prolog:
?- [Student_Marks_Management].

Run sample queries:

?- pass(mamun, math).
?- grade(anika, physics, Grade).
?- topper(Student).
?- eligible_for_scholarship(anika).
